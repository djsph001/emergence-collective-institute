# Methodology Note: How Article IV Was Built

Article IV was developed through iterative drafting, hostile-lawyer review, and governance-focused scenario testing, in collaboration with advanced AI systems and with reference to contemporary constitutional scholarship.

## Iterative Drafting

Multiple rounds of revision aimed at tightening language, closing loopholes, and balancing powers across branches and within the AI Branch itself.

Each section was rewritten 3-5 times based on constitutional law review, scenario testing, and adversarial critique.

## Hostile-Lawyer Review

Each section was stress-tested against adversarial interpretations:
- How could a bad actor exploit this?
- What if Congress tried to weaponize it?
- What if the Administrator or the Executive Branch went rogue?
- What if a future court interpreted this in the worst possible way?

The goal: write text that closes backdoors before they're discovered.

## Governance-Focused Scenario Testing

We ran explicit simulations:
- Climate policy deadlock
- Privacy overreach attempts
- Political pressure on the Administrator
- Foreign data poisoning and cyberattacks
- Long-term promises-vs-outcomes scorecards

In each case, we identified which safeguards would activate, found weaknesses in the text, and revised to harden the framework.

The Stress Tests document is the public record of this process.

## AI-Assisted Constitutional Design

Advanced AI systems (Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-4, and others) were used to draft constitutional language, propose potential loopholes and exploits, model institutional failure modes, and simulate legal challenges.

Human judgment remained final at every stage, especially on questions of rights, power, and enforcement.

AI was a tool for adversarial testing, not the author of constitutional principles.

## Grounding in Contemporary Scholarship

The design is informed by current debates in:
- Administrative law (non-delegation doctrine, Chevron deference, agency independence)
- AI governance (transparency, accountability, human oversight)
- Privacy protections (data minimization, surveillance limits, impact assessments)
- Constitutional structure (separation of powers, checks and balances)

We drew on law review articles on non-delegation and AI, NIST AI Risk Management Framework, EU AI Act principles (adapted for U.S. constitutional context), and academic work on algorithmic accountability.

This is not invented from scratch. It synthesizes existing frameworks into a new constitutional structure.

## The Result

Article IV is not sacred text.

It is a working prototype meant to be criticized by legal scholars, stress-tested by policymakers, adapted by jurisdictions with different needs, and improved by people who know more, have different perspectives, or want to port it to their own systems.

If you find a flaw, that's a feature - it means the design can be improved.

The Institute's goal is not to have the final answer, but to put a serious, forkable proposal into the world so the real debate can begin.
