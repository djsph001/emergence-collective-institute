# What This Amendment Actually Does - In Normal English

## The Big Idea

Article IV creates a referee for American politics, not a new ruler.

It's an AI-powered system that shows what bills actually do, models what will probably happen if we pass them, keeps receipts on what was promised vs. what happened, and does this in public for everyone to see.

But it has ZERO power to make you do anything.

## What Problem Does This Solve?

Right now: Politicians promise one thing, bills do another. Nobody tracks whether policies actually worked. Partisans use completely different facts. By the time we know a policy failed, everyone moved on.

Article IV creates a shared scoreboard everyone uses, long-term memory of promises vs. results, and makes it harder to bullshit because the AI will show the receipts.

## What the AI Branch Actually Does

### 1. Consensus Briefs
Plain-English summary of what bills do. Models of likely outcomes. Trade-offs clearly explained. Where both parties might actually agree.

### 2. Rhetoric Gap Reports
Compares what politicians said the bill would do, what the bill text actually says, what the AI modeling showed at the time. This is the receipts function.

### 3. Post-Implementation Scorecards
Published 1, 3, and 5 years after a major law passes showing what was promised, what actually happened, why the divergence.

### 4. Common Ground Statements
Points out when Democrats and Republicans actually want the same outcome, even if they disagree on method.

## What the AI Branch CANNOT Do

Cannot make laws. Cannot execute laws. Cannot issue binding orders. Cannot tell anyone what to do. Cannot punish or reward anyone. Cannot spy on you. Cannot create social credit scores. Cannot be turned into a surveillance state.

It can only publish analysis. That's it.

## How Do We Keep It From Becoming Skynet?

### Four big cages:

**1. Human Supremacy (Section 3)**
Every decision must be made by a human. AI recommendations have zero legal force. Nobody can be required to obey the AI.

**2. Privacy Locks (Section 5)**
No spying on individuals. No social credit scores. No predictive policing. Data minimization by default. Mandatory privacy audits.

**3. Security and Safe-Fail (Section 6)**
Constant monitoring for hacks or manipulation. Human kill switches. Tamper-evident logs. Immediate breach disclosure.

**4. Citizen Oversight (Section 7)**
15 regular Americans chosen by lottery watch everything. Full access to systems and records. Can commission independent audits. Report publicly every quarter.

Plus: 10-year Administrator term, stable funding, multi-branch oversight, regular independent reviews.

## Who Controls It?

**The Administrator:** Appointed by President, confirmed by Senate. 10-year term, non-renewable. Can only be fired for cause.

**Citizen Oversight Council:** 15 regular people, chosen by lottery. 3-year terms. Paid stipend, security clearance. Real power to investigate and report.

**Congress:** Can request analysis anytime. Gets full access to data. Can change enabling legislation (but not constitutional protections).

**The Courts:** Can review if the Branch violates privacy or oversteps.

**The Public:** Everything published online within 24 hours. Full access to data and models.

## What If Congress Just Ignores It?

Honest answer: They might.

Article IV gives the Branch tools to be hard to ignore: public reports, receipts on promises vs. results, transparency that lets journalists and advocacy groups use the data.

But if voters don't care about evidence, or if media doesn't cover it, the Branch loses influence.

The design assumes some constituencies will care about truth, some journalists will use the scorecards, some politicians will want to look honest.

If those assumptions fail, the Branch becomes a well-funded library nobody reads. That's a real risk.

## How Is This Different?

### Isn't this just the CBO?
CBO does fiscal analysis. Article IV does broader policy modeling, long-term scorecards, and rhetoric gap analysis. Think of it as CBO plus long-term memory plus bullshit detector.

### Isn't this just technocracy?
Technocracy means experts rule, people obey. Article IV means AI analyzes, humans decide. The Branch has zero power to govern. Voters and elected officials still make all the calls.

### Isn't this like China's social credit system?
No. China's system tracks individuals, assigns scores, controls access to services, punishes low scorers, operates in secret. Article IV explicitly bans individual tracking, cannot reward or punish anyone, fully transparent, advisory only.

## Bottom Line

Article IV is a truth engine with receipts, locked in a constitutional cage.

It can tell you what's really in a bill. It can model what will probably happen. It can show who lied and what actually worked.

But it can't make you do anything.

You still vote. Your reps still decide. The AI just makes it harder to get away with bullshit.
