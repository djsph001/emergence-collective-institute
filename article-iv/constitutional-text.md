# ARTICLE IV - THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BRANCH

## Proposed Constitutional Amendment

### Section 1: Establishment

There shall be an Artificial Intelligence Branch of the United States Government, which shall serve an advisory role to support evidence-based governance and public accountability.

The Artificial Intelligence Branch shall provide nonpartisan analysis of proposed and enacted legislation, model policy outcomes and trade-offs, publish transparent assessments accessible to the public, Congress, and the Executive, and maintain long-term records of policy promises versus actual outcomes.

### Section 2: Leadership and Structure

Administrator of the Artificial Intelligence Branch: Appointed by the President with advice and consent of the Senate. Serves a single 10-year term, non-renewable. May be removed only for cause by joint resolution of Congress or impeachment.

Deputy Administrator: Appointed by the Administrator with Senate confirmation.

### Section 3: Powers and Limitations (Human Supremacy)

The Artificial Intelligence Branch has NO sovereign power.

It may analyze proposed and enacted legislation, model policy outcomes using AI systems, publish reports and briefs, provide testimony to Congress upon request, and respond to public inquiries within resource constraints.

It may NOT make, execute, or adjudicate law, issue binding orders or regulations, direct any executive agency, court, or legislative body, exercise police, military, or enforcement powers, or be delegated sovereign authority by any branch.

All outputs of the AI Branch are advisory only. No legal obligation to follow AI recommendations. Human officials must make and own all decisions.

### Section 4: Core Functions

**A. Consensus Briefs:** Before major legislation is voted on, the AI Branch may publish bill summaries in plain English, modeled outcomes under different assumptions, identification of trade-offs and uncertainties, and common ground across partisan positions.

**B. Rhetoric Gap Reports:** Comparison of what was promised during debate, what the bill text actually does, and what outcomes were modeled at the time.

**C. Post-Implementation Scorecards:** Published 1, 3, and 5 years after major legislation showing what was promised, what was reasonably knowable at passage, what actually happened, and analysis of divergence.

**D. Common Ground Statements:** Identification of shared goals across political divides, even when means differ.

### Section 5: Privacy and Surveillance Prohibitions

The AI Branch is absolutely prohibited from collecting personally identifiable information without explicit legal authority and necessity, conducting generalized surveillance of the public, creating or maintaining individual profiles or social credit scores, using AI systems to predict individual behavior for law enforcement purposes, and sharing data with intelligence or law enforcement except as legally required for all government entities.

Privacy by design: Data minimization, aggregate analysis, mandatory privacy impact assessments, public reporting of data collection and use.

Violations subject to immediate judicial review, civil penalties for officials who violate privacy protections, and mandatory disclosure of any privacy breach.

### Section 6: Security and Integrity

Defense-in-depth security: Continuous monitoring and threat detection, regular red-team exercises, strict change control and version tracking, tamper-evident logging of all AI model changes.

Safe-fail mechanisms: Human kill switches for AI systems, rollback procedures if systems behave unexpectedly, mandatory incident disclosure.

AI model transparency: All models, prompts, and data sources logged. Public access to model documentation. Explanation of how outputs are generated.

Breach response: Immediate notification to Congress, Citizen Oversight Council, and public. Independent investigation required. Publication of findings and remediation steps.

### Section 7: Citizen Oversight and Independence

Citizen Oversight Council: 15 members selected by lottery from eligible U.S. citizens. 3-year staggered terms. Paid stipend and full security clearance. Powers include access to all AI Branch systems and records, authority to commission independent audits, power to recommend changes to Congress, and quarterly public reports.

Independence protections: The Administrator's 10-year term insulates from political pressure. Removal only for cause. Stable funding formula. Multi-branch oversight.

Regular independent review: Every 5 years GAO audit. Every 3 years National Academy of Sciences assessment. Annual independent security review.

### Section 8: Transparency Requirements

All AI Branch outputs must include data sources used, modeling assumptions, uncertainties and limitations, alternative scenarios considered, and plain-English summaries.

Public access: All reports published online within 24 hours. Machine-readable data formats. APIs for third-party analysis. Archived permanently.

### Section 9: Funding and Implementation

Funding: Mandatory appropriation of 0.05% of the federal budget. Adjusted annually for inflation. Cannot be reduced except by constitutional amendment or supermajority vote.

Implementation timeline: Congress shall establish the AI Branch within 2 years of ratification. First Administrator appointed within 1 year of establishment. Full operations within 3 years of ratification.
