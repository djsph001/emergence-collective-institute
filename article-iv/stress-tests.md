# Stress Tests of Article IV

## Purpose

These stress tests show what happens when bad actors try to exploit the system, which constitutional sections activate as defenses, and where the framework is strong or might fail.

## Test 1: Climate Policy Deadlock

### Scenario
Congress is divided 50-50 on a major climate bill. Both parties request AI Branch analysis.

The AI Branch publishes:
- Consensus Brief showing the bill would reduce emissions by 15-22% over 10 years
- Common Ground Statement: both parties want job creation and energy security
- Rhetoric Gap Report: bill sponsors claimed "no job losses" but modeling shows 50,000 fossil fuel jobs lost, offset by 80,000 clean energy jobs gained

Political reaction: Fossil fuel state senators accuse the AI Branch of bias. Environmental groups accuse it of underestimating climate risk. The President pressures the Administrator to revise the analysis.

### Which Safeguards Fire

**Section 7 (Independence):** Administrator has a 10-year term, removable only for cause. President cannot fire for political reasons. Stable funding prevents budget retaliation.

**Section 8 (Transparency):** All modeling assumptions published. Alternative scenarios included. Uncertainty ranges clearly stated. Third parties can verify the math.

**Section 7 (Citizen Oversight):** Citizen Oversight Council reviews the analysis, publishes its own report confirming proper process, notes political pressure but finds no evidence of manipulation.

**Section 3 (Human Supremacy):** The analysis is advisory only. Congress is free to vote however it wants.

### Outcome
The bill passes by 1 vote. Both sides claim the AI Branch proved them right. But the Rhetoric Gap Report becomes a tool for journalists. 5 years later, the Scorecard shows emissions down 18% (within predicted range), job losses/gains roughly matched predictions, transition assistance was underfunded.

**The Branch worked as designed: it didn't determine the outcome, but it made bullshit harder.**

## Test 2: Privacy Overreach Attempt

### Scenario
A new Administration wants to use the AI Branch to identify "high-risk communities" for targeted social programs.

The request: "Use AI modeling to predict which zip codes will have the highest rates of unemployment, crime, and school dropout, so we can pre-deploy resources."

### Which Safeguards Fire

**Section 5 (Privacy Prohibitions):** The AI Branch is explicitly prohibited from creating individual profiles, predicting individual behavior, or conducting surveillance. The request is for population-level prediction, which seems okay, but could be a backdoor to profiling.

**Administrator's response:** Publishes a public memo explaining they can model economic trends at the zip code level using aggregate data, will NOT create risk scores for individuals, will NOT recommend targeting specific people, and this analysis is for resource allocation only, not surveillance.

**Section 7 (Citizen Oversight Council):** Demands a privacy impact assessment. Requires the AI Branch to publish exact data sources, confirmation that no PII is used, and safeguards against re-identification.

**Section 6 (Security and Integrity):** Tamper-evident logs show exactly what data was accessed. Independent audit confirms no individual-level data was processed.

### Outcome
The AI Branch publishes zip code-level economic projections. Explicitly states this is NOT a social credit system or individual risk score. Civil liberties groups monitor closely. One year later, GAO audit confirms no privacy violations.

**The cage held. The request was legal, but the safeguards prevented mission creep.**

## Test 3: Political Pressure on the Administrator

### Scenario
The Administrator publishes a Rhetoric Gap Report showing that the President's signature economic policy is underperforming its promises.

Political fallout: The President publicly attacks the Administrator. Allied senators threaten to cut the AI Branch budget. Opposition party demands the Administrator testify.

### Which Safeguards Fire

**Section 7 (Independence):** The Administrator cannot be fired except for cause. Impeachment requires House majority vote and Senate conviction (2/3 vote). Budget cannot be cut below constitutional minimum (0.05% of federal budget).

**Section 2 (10-year term):** Administrator was appointed by the previous President. Designed to outlast political cycles.

**Section 8 (Transparency):** The Rhetoric Gap Report is fully documented. Data sources public. Modeling assumptions public. Alternative scenarios included. Third-party economists can verify the analysis.

**Section 7 (Citizen Oversight Council):** Council reviews the political pressure, publishes a report finding no evidence of bias or manipulation. Notes that the Administrator followed proper methodology.

### Outcome
The President's attacks generate media attention. Some outlets defend the Administrator, others question the AI Branch's role. Congress holds hearings. The Administrator testifies calmly, presents the methodology. Budget cut threats fail. Administrator remains in office.

2 years later, economic data confirms the AI Branch's analysis was accurate. The Scorecard becomes a citation in academic papers and opposition campaign ads.

**The cage held. Political pressure happened, but the structural protections worked.**

## Test 4: Nation-State Hack

### Scenario
A foreign intelligence service hacks the AI Branch and attempts to poison the training data, manipulate model outputs to favor certain policies, and steal sensitive congressional analysis.

### Which Safeguards Fire

**Section 6 (Security and Integrity):**

Defense-in-depth: Continuous monitoring detects unusual access patterns. Red-team exercises had simulated this exact attack. Tamper-evident logs show unauthorized changes.

Safe-fail mechanisms: Human kill switch activated immediately. AI systems taken offline. Rollback to last known-good state.

Mandatory breach disclosure: Within 24 hours, the Administrator notifies Congress, Citizen Oversight Council, and the public. Full incident report published within 7 days.

**Section 7 (Citizen Oversight + Independent Review):** Council commissions emergency independent audit. National Academy of Sciences verifies system integrity. GAO conducts forensic review.

### Investigation Findings
Attack originated from known APT group. Data poisoning attempt detected before deployment. No model outputs were compromised. Congressional analysis data was encrypted. Logs show exactly what was accessed and when.

### Outcome
AI Branch systems offline for 3 weeks during remediation. Independent audit confirms no published analysis was compromised, security protocols worked as designed, improvements recommended. Congress passes emergency funding for enhanced security. Administrator publishes lessons learned.

**The cage held. The attack was detected, contained, and disclosed. Transparency prevented coverup.**

## Summary: Do the Safeguards Hold?

| Test | Attack Vector | Safeguards That Fired | Outcome |
|------|--------------|---------------------|---------|
| Climate Deadlock | Political pressure, accusations of bias | Independence, Transparency, Citizen Oversight | Analysis published, pressure resisted |
| Privacy Overreach | Attempt to create profiling system | Privacy prohibitions, Citizen Council, Audits | Request modified, no individual tracking |
| Administrator Under Fire | Presidential attack, budget threats | 10-year term, removal for cause only, funding floor | Administrator remained, analysis stood |
| Nation-State Hack | Data poisoning, manipulation, theft | Security monitoring, kill switches, breach disclosure | Attack detected, systems recovered |

## Conclusion

The cages are strong. Not perfect - determined political actors can still ignore evidence, and voter apathy can sideline the Branch. But the constitutional safeguards make it very hard to turn the Branch into Skynet, weaponize it for surveillance, capture it politically, or hide when it's attacked.

That's the design: a truth engine that's powerful in analysis, weak in coercion, and caged by law.
